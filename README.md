The project aims to be an aggregator for election information in Romania. The project will contain historic information for elections in Romania, will contain real time results for each election, as it will parse results published by BEC (Biroul Electoral Central) and it will also contain information about the budgets spent during the electoral campaign.

[See the project live](insert_link_here)

The partial results published by BEC (Biroul Electoral Central) are often raw results that are not easily interpreted and give no meaningful information to regular users. The aim of the project is to aggregate the raw data and provide timely updates on the progression of voting results in Romanian elections.
